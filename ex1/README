Assignment 1:
The program duplicates the file STDERR to another file descriptor, gets its permissions (read/write) and other data (using fstat which writes to the supplied struct "stat") and then writes an error message.
The error message is that it needs arguments to run, prints "Success" and exits with error code 0.
