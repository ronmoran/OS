Assignment 1:
The program duplicates the file STDERR to another file descriptor, gets its permissions (read/write) and other data
(using fstat which writes to the supplied struct "stat") and then writes an error message.
The error message is that it needs arguments to run, prints "Success" and exits with error code 0.
If an argument is supplied a directory named "Welcome" is created, in it a directory named "To"
is created and in it a file named "OS2021" is opened for writing.
The message "<username>\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n1" is written to the file
and the number of bytes written is returned.
Lastly the opened file is removed, then the containing directory "To" and the containing directory "Welcome" is removed.


Assignment 2:

We created a main file which is not included in the tar to run the three functions.
The function "osm_operation_time" was a bit tricky since there are some compiler optimization which might
skip the actual addition process. That's the case for lines such as "x = 5 + 8" because the compiler performs the
addition and just stores the value 13 in x directly.
We compiled the file using the "-S" flag and checked the assembly instructions. There it was visible that
an addition operation is carried out multiple times per iteration, it is not saved to the memory after each iteration
but to the register, and other repeating lines also compile to repeating ASM instructions.
Only then did we know that the functions actually run the operations multiple time without any compiler optimizations
